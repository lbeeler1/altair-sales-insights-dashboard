# Sales Insights Dashboard

**Driving Business Decisions Through Sales Data**  
*An interactive data visualization project using Altair and Python*

## Project Overview

This project explores a transactional dataset from a UK-based online retail company that sells unique all-occasion gifts. The dataset contains sales transactions from December 2010 to December 2011, with fields such as:

- Invoice number  
- Stock code  
- Product description  
- Quantity  
- Invoice date  
- Unit price  
- Customer ID  
- Country

### Key Objectives

- Identify top-selling products by total revenue (Quantity × Unit Price)  
- Visualize sales trends over time  
- Compare revenue performance across countries (excluding the UK for clarity)
