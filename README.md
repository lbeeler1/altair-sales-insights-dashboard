Sales Insights Dashboard
Driving Business Decisions Through Sales Data
An interactive data visualization project using Altair and Python

Project Overview
This project explores a transactional dataset from a UK-based online retail company that sells unique all-occasion gifts. The data includes sales transactions from December 2010 to December 2011 and contains fields such as invoice number, stock code, product description, quantity, invoice date, unit price, customer ID, and country.

The main goals of this project are:

Identify the top-selling products by total revenue (quantity Ã— unit price)

Visualize sales trends over time

Compare revenue performance across countries

The United Kingdom was excluded from country-level analysis to reduce noise and highlight the top-performing non-UK markets.

Project Structure
Jupyter Notebook: Contains the code for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization

Visualizations: Includes the interactive HTML dashboard and supporting files

The dashboard includes:

A bar chart showing the top 10 products by revenue

A line chart of total revenue over time, filterable by country

A bar chart comparing revenue by country (excluding the UK)

Design Approach
The visualizations were chosen for clarity and insight:

Top Products: The bar chart makes it easy to see which products contribute most to revenue

Sales Over Time: The line chart highlights seasonal trends and key spikes

Revenue by Country: Allows comparison of geographic performance

The dashboard uses consistent color schemes, interactivity, and a minimalist design to support usability and insight generation.

Evaluation
Two participants were asked to use the dashboard to answer business-relevant questions, including:

What is the top product by revenue?

How does revenue change over time?

Which countries are most profitable?

The evaluation showed that the dashboard was intuitive to use and effectively supported data-driven insights.

The dataset is publicly available from Kaggle:
